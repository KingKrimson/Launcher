I've commented on the source code where appropriate.

Ben Jordan Launcher 1.2
Made by Andrew Brown 2012

The Ben Jordan games and the image used in the launcher are © 2004-2012 Francisco Gonzalez.

If you don't have the Ben Jordan games, they can be downloaded from www.grundislavgames.com.

---INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE---

When the launcher first starts up, a file chooser will pop-up. Locate the directory where you keep the Ben Jordan games, 
and click accept. Currently, the folders the games are kept in must be titled like so:

Ben Jordan 1
Ben Jordan 1 Deluxe 
Ben Jordan 2
Ben Jordan 2 Deluxe
Ben Jordan 3
Ben Jordan 4
Ben Jordan 5
Ben Jordan 6
Ben Jordan 7
Ben Jordan 8

If you change where you keep the games, click on the "Change Directory" button to, well, change the directory.

You can access the setup programs from the launcher by clicking the "Toggle Setup" button, and then clicking on the
appropriate game. To access the games again, click on the "Toggle Games" button. Unfortunately, old Winsetups
don't play nice with Windows UAC, so in order to access the setups for Ben Jordan 1-7, UAC must be turned off.

Have Fun!
